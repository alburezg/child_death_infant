# Questions ----

# For the 20-44 measure, do you count child deaths that happened when the mother was 15-19 yo?



# Estimate the cumulative number of child deaths (CCD)
# experienced for women finishing their reproductive life.
# ESG uses the agr groups 20-44 and 45-49

# This means that CD is the mean value of the cumulative number 
# of child death for all mothers currently aged, for example, 45-49 I.e. the sum 
# of all child deaths experienced in the 15-49 period for all 
# women currently aged 45-49
# ï‚§	For time frame: 2010-2019

# We can use our data to estimate this directly using the mean value 
# of CD_{c, 20-44} and CD_{c, 45-49}



# Eventually we need to transform these measure from cohort to period
# but I am not sure if I should get the mean values first and the convert
# or the other way around

# 0. Parameters ----

width <- 20
height <- 14

# 1. Cohort to Period ----

# We approximate period values from cohort estimates
# by taking values on the diagonal

# First, reduce size of data, then get period values

years <- 2010:2019

  select(country, cohort, age, child_death) %>% 
  mutate(year = cohort + age) %>% 
  select(country, year, age, child_death) %>% 
  arrange(country, year, age)
  
# 2. Get mean CD value for age gr ----

cm <- cd_p %>% 
  filter(year %in% years) %>% 
  filter(between(age, min(breaks), max(breaks))) %>% 
  # create age groups
