Sharing data here. Have included maternal repeat offspring indicator for countries we can calculate them for--also include 95% & 99% CIs. 
Definitely seems that the clustering is highly correlated with the extent of difference between kin cohort & direct estimates. 
I wanted to share w. you now in case you have any epiphanies or ideas about where discrepancy emerging
--but I will also loop back to you and Emilio once I have time to explore the patterns more.

The confidence intervals are the “lb99_” and “ub99_” values. Included 99% and 95%. 
Also, I didn’t create the ICC yet, but instead the comparable “mrom45” which tells us the # of women who lost more than one kid. 
Sorry typing this on phone, but let me know if have other questions. 
Hopefully other variable names clear.
